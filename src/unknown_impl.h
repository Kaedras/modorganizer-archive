/* This implements a common way of creating classes which implement one or more
 * COM interfaces.
 *
 * Your implementaton should be something like this
 *
 * class MyImplementation :
 *  public interface1,
 *  public interface2 //etc to taste
 * {
 *     UNKNOWN_1_INTERFACE(interface1);
 * or  UNKNOWN_2_INTERFACE(interface1, interface2); etc
 *
 * It would probably be possible to do something very magic with macros
 * that allowed you to do
 * class My_Implmentation : UNKNOWN_IMPL_n(interface1, ...)
 *
 * that did all the above for you, but I can't see how to maintain the braces
 * in order to make the class declaration look nice.
 *
 * You might ask why I have e-implemented this from the 7-zip stuff (sort of).
 *
 * Well,
 *
 * Firstly, the 7zip macros are slightly buggy (they don't null the outpointer
 * if the interface isn't found), and they aren't thread safe.
 *
 * Secondly, although 7-zip has a requirement to run on platforms other than
 * windows, we don't. So I changed this to use the Com functionality supplied
 * by windows, which (potentially) has better debugging facilities
 *
 * Thirdly, this removes a number of dependencies on 7-zip source which aren't
 * really part of the API
